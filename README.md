# PyTorch HCR

[[_TOC_]]

## 🚀 Description

Project for the Hauptseminar "Introduction to Neural Networks and Sequence-To-Sequence Learning" SoSe 2024.

The goal of this project is to implement a simple Optical Character Recognition Model in PyTorch. 
The trained model is tested on the captcha and IAM Handwriting Word dataset.

Details of the implementation and the experiment results can be found in the project report.


## 📁 Project structure

TODO     


## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.11

To run the scripts in this project, ensure you have the required packages and modules installed. You can find them listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements using the following command:

```
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Prepare dataset:
Follow these instructions to get the IAM dataset:
    - Register for free at this website
    - Download words/words.tgz and unpack into ./data, so that a directory ./data/words exists with sub-directories a01, a02 etc.
    - Download ascii/words.txt and unpack into ./data/ascii/words.txt
